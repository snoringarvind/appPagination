<h1>App Pagination</h1>
<p>You can visulaize you data-sets via infinite scroll or in the form of pages. But since the data can easily get pretty huge for infinite scrolling, we can use pagination for such scenarios. This App Pagination directive helps you to create pages for your data. All you have to do is insert this directive in you template file and it returns a callback with the current page number and sliced values. </p>

<h2>Angular Version</h2>
<p>This Angular directive is created using Angular 12+ .</p>

<h2>How to install</h2>
<p>npm i snoring-pagination</p>

<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>Open your template file where you want to implement you pagination. </p>
